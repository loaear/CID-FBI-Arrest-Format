Casefile Arrest Report || CID
Description
The Casefile Arrest Report application is designed to help CID agents document arrest details efficiently. This user-friendly tool allows agents to generate BBCode for forum posts, capturing all pertinent details about an arrest.

How It Works

Generating the BBCode
Once all necessary fields are filled, click the "Generate BBCode" button. This will create the BBCode and copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this BBCode into your desired forum or documentation tool.

Clearing Fields
If you need to start over, click the "Clear" button to reset all fields.

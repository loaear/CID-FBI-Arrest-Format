Casefile Arrest Report || CID
Description
The Casefile Arrest Report application is designed to help CID agents document arrest details efficiently. This user-friendly tool allows agents to generate BBCode for forum posts, capturing all pertinent details about an arrest.

How It Works
Agent Details: Enter your name in the "Agent Name" field. This is a required field.
Assistants: List any assisting agents in the "Assistants" field. If there are no assistants, you can use the "none" button.
Suspect Details: Enter the full name of the suspect in the "Suspect Name" field. This is a required field.
Date of Arrest: Provide the date of the arrest in the "Date of Arrest" field. You can click the "Today's Date" button to automatically fill in the current date.
Type of Arrest: Specify the type of arrest by selecting "Normal" or "High Risk". The corresponding description will be filled automatically.
High Risk Arrest Evidence: If applicable, provide evidence for high-risk arrests. You can also use predefined entries like "none" or "MW".
Confiscations:
Drugs Confiscated: Enter details of any drugs confiscated during the arrest.
Arms Confiscated: Enter details of any arms confiscated during the arrest.
Additional Evidence:
Frisk: Provide evidence or notes related to the frisk of the suspect.
Confiscation: Include evidence or notes related to confiscations.
Last Charges: Enter details about the suspect's last charges.
Arrest & Inmates: Provide any relevant details about the arrest and related inmates.
Generating the BBCode
Once all necessary fields are filled, click the "Generate BBCode" button. This will create the BBCode and copy it to your clipboard. You can then paste this BBCode into your desired forum or documentation tool.

Clearing Fields
If you need to start over, click the "Clear" button to reset all fields.
